Stock Prediction Portal

Full-Stack Application with Django REST, React, and Machine Learning

# Project Overview

This project is a full-stack stock prediction portal that combines backend development, frontend development, and machine learning into a single real-world application.

The backend is built using Django REST Framework, the frontend uses React.js, and the prediction logic is powered by a deep learning LSTM model trained on historical stock price data.

The goal of this project is educational: to demonstrate how machine learning models can be integrated into modern web applications using REST APIs.

- Architecture of the System

- Backend: Django + Django REST Framework

- Frontend: React.js

- Machine Learning: LSTM Neural Network (Keras / TensorFlow)

- Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy

- Visualization: Matplotlib

- The machine learning model is trained separately in a Jupyter \* Notebook and then integrated into the backend via a REST API.

# Features

- RESTful API built with Django REST Framework

- React.js frontend for user interaction

- User authentication system

- Machine learning–based stock price prediction

- LSTM deep learning model for time-series analysis

- JSON-based communication between frontend and backend

- Machine Learning Approach

- it takes a practical, use-case-driven approach that could applied in real-world.

# Topics Covered:

1. Basics of machine learning and its main types

2. Choosing the right ML approach for a given problem

3. When and why deep learning is appropriate

4. How neural networks work at a high level

5. Why an LSTM model is suitable for stock price prediction

# Model Details:

1. Built using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks

2. Trained on historical stock price data

3. Designed for time-series prediction

4. Saved in .keras format and loaded into Django

5. The trained model is exposed via an API endpoint and consumed by the frontend.

# API Integration

# Once the model is trained:

The model is saved in .keras format

Django loads the model on server startup

A REST API endpoint receives input data

The model generates predictions

The response is returned as JSON

React displays the results in the portal

Additional Skills Demonstrated

Data manipulation with Pandas and NumPy

Data visualization with Matplotlib

REST API design

Frontend–backend integration

Full-stack project architecture

Machine learning model deployment

Important Disclaimer

This prediction model should NOT be used for real stock market trading.

The model is developed purely for educational purposes to demonstrate:

Machine learning concepts

Time-series prediction

ML integration with web applications

Using this model for real financial decisions may result in significant financial loss.
